# Tic-Tac-Toe-Python-
A classic two-player Tic‑Tac‑Toe game implemented in Python. Players take alternating turns placing X and O on a 3×3 board. The game detects wins (rows, columns, diagonals), ties, and includes options to replay upon completion—available in both console and GUI (Tkinter) modes.
